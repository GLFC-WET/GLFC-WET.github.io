```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(blogdown)
```

## Website Basis

The website skeleton is adapted from the wowchemy academic-starter theme. Which can be downloaded below.

```{r update_hugo}
## Make sure you have most recent version of hugo installed

blogdown::new_site(theme = "wowchemy/starter-academic", sample=TRUE)

```

Initial example site used as basis, then modifications made to css, js and html to allow for pages to be made in the required ways.

## Make sure you have most recent version of hugo installed

```{r update_hugo}
blogdown::hugo_version()
## if you don't have the newest, update
blogdown::install_hugo()
## update options for new version
options(blogdown.hugo.version = "0.82.0")

```

## Create a version of the website for the web


```{r publish}
blogdown::hugo_build(local=FALSE, relativeURLs = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
