bio: My research focuses on how the connections between land and inland waters are altered by climate change. I completed my Ph.D. in Plant Sciences focusing on how disturbances, such as insect outbreaks, fire, or anthropogenic influence alter the nutrient cycling of aquatic ecosystems. By understanding how inland waters respond to landscape changes, we can better predict overall productivity of these systems and how they contribute to the global carbon cycle. o characterise these effect I combined remote sensing with field measurement to identify drivers of regional change. Alongside my research interests, I also enjoy R coding, teaching, mentoring, and making maps.
