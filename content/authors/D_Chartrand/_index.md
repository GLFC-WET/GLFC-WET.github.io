I am an Environmental and Ecotoxicology Technologist with the Canadian Forest Service of Natural Resources Canada.  Since graduating in 1996, I have contributed technical support to the planning, conducting and reporting of laboratory and field experiments within a wide variety of projects relating to Canadian forested ecosystems.  I bring diverse experiential and technical skills to these studies quantitative analytical chemistry, GPS and radiotelemetry of species at risk, GIS-based spatial analysis and most recently sampling and assessment of macroinvertebrate community via metabarcoding.
