bio: I grew up in the middle of the northwoods of Wisconsin following my silviculturalist mom around on her field days which utterly convinced me ecology was the only path for me. I just graduated from Northern Michigan University in Marquette, MI with a B.S. in Environmental Science with a Water Resources Concentration. During my undergrad, I was a reserach assistant at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Limnology Trout Lake Station with Susan Knight and Gretchen Gerrish and the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa on a wild rice phenology project. Now, I'm starting my M.Sc. at Trent University in January working with boreal systems, fire ecology, and eddy flux.
