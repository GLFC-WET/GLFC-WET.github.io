**The Watershed Ecology Team is a research group at Natural Resource Canada's Great Lakes Forestry Centre in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada.**

We study how aquatic ecosystem functions and services are influenced by watershed-scale processes, and the ways that forest disturbances and land management decisions influence these process and ecosystem responses. 

Our group integrates fine-scale microbial and molecular processes across spatial and temporal scales, to inform land-based resource management and policies to mitigate and avoid impacts on freshwater resources.
