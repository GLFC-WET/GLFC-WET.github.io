abstract: "Though effects of forest harvesting on small streams are well documented, little is known about the cumulative effects in downstream systems. The hierarchical nature and longitudinal connectivity of river networks make them fundamentally cumulative, but lateral and vertical connectivity and instream processes can dissipate the downstream transport of water and materials. To elucidate such effects, we investigated how a suite of abiotic indicators changed from small streams to larger downstream sites (n = 6) within three basins ranging in forest management intensity (intensive, extensive, minimal) in New Brunswick (Canada) in the summer and fall of 2017 and 2018. Inorganic sediments, the inorganic/organic ratios and water temperatures significantly increased longitudinally, whereas nutrients and the fluorescence index of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; indication of terrestrial source) decreased. However, some â€¦"
