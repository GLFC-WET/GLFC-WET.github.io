abstract: "Managed forests contribute to both economic and non-timber values, but the ecological role of managed, including planted, forests to biodiversity objectives at the landscape scale needs to be better understood. In this project in collaboration with J.D. Irving, Limited, we: 1) used airborne LiDAR and field data to identify terrestrial habitats; 2) monitored selected taxa by 18 stand type/seral stage habitat types in intensively and extensively managed forests and reserves; 3) assessed effects of management intensity on water quality and aquatic habitat; and 4) projected forest and wildlife habitat under planned management and natural disturbance scenarios. Taxa studied included songbirds, bryophytes and beetle species associated with mature-overmature forests, and several listed ground vegetation species. LiDAR-based enhanced forest inventory provided forest structure variables that improved bird habitat models …"
