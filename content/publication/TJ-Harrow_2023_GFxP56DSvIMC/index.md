abstract: "Methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations in boreal headwater streams are influenced by complex natural processes and disturbances such as forestry management. Understanding drivers of MeHg within boreal streams in Ontario, Canada, is of particular interest as there are legacy MeHg concerns. However, models accounting for the complexity of underlying processes have not yet been developed. We assessed how catchment characteristics and stream water chemistry influence MeHg concentrations within 19 watersheds of the Dryden – Wabigoon Forest in Ontario, Canada, using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. Despite the study area encompassing a large variation of boreal forest watersheds in the Canadian Shield, our SEM had substantial explanatory power across the region (χ251 = 45.37, p-value = 0.70, R2 = 0.75). Nitrate concentrations (p-value <0.001), water temperature (p-value = 0 …"
