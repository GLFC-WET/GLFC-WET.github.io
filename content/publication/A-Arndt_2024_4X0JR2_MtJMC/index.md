abstract: "Crayfish rely on their chemosensory system for many essential behaviours including finding food, finding mates, and to recognize individuals. Copper can impair chemosensation in crayfish at low concentrations; however, it is not clear if the effect is ameliorated once copper is removed. To better understand the effect of and recovery from copper exposure in crayfish, we exposed Northern clearwater crayfish (Faxonius propinquus) to 31.3 g/L copper for 24h and measured the response of the crayfish to a food cue. The crayfish were then placed into clean water to depurate for an 24h. The results…"
