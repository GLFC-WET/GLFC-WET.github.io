abstract: "Forest insect outbreaks cause significant reductions in the forest canopy through defoliation and tree mortality that modify the storage and flow of water, altering catchment runoff and stream discharge patterns. Despite a growing understanding of the impacts of insect outbreaks on the hydrology of broadleaf forests, little is known about these impacts to catchment hydrology in northern conifer-dominated forests. We measured the effects of cumulative defoliation by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) on stream discharge and runoff in 12 experimental catchments (6.33–9.85 km2) across the central Gaspé Peninsula in eastern Québec, Canada over a three-year period (2019–2021). Six catchments were aerially treated with BtK (Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki) insecticide to suppress the outbreak and six catchments were left untreated, leading to a defoliation gradient across the study sites. Stage-discharge …"
