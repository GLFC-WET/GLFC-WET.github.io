abstract: "Boreal lakes are major components of the global carbon cycle, partly because of sediment‐bound heterotrophic microorganisms that decompose within‐lake and terrestrially derived organic matter (t‐OM). The ability for sediment bacteria to break down and alter t‐OM may depend on environmental characteristics and community composition. However, the connection between these two potential drivers of decomposition is poorly understood. We tested how bacterial activity changed along experimental gradients in the quality and quantity of t‐OM inputs into littoral sediments of two small boreal lakes, a dark and a clear lake, and measured the abundance of operational taxonomic units and functional genes to identify mechanisms underlying bacterial responses. We found that bacterial production (BP) decreased across lakes with aromatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sediment pore water, but the process …"
