abstract: "The study of microbial communities of the plant phyllosphere in remote locations using DNA-based approaches is limited by the challenges associated with their preservation in the field and during transportation. Freezing is a common DNA preservation strategy, but it may be unsuitable for leaf samples, or inaccessible in some locations. Other methods such as desiccation, ethanol or commercial preservatives are potential alternative DNA preservation methods for ambient temperature storage. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of desiccation (with silica gel packs), and of three preservation solutions (95% ethanol, RNAlater, LifeGuard) for the preservation of epiphytic phyllosphere communities of Populus tremuloides and Picea glauca at ambient indoor temperature (21 °C) for up to three weeks. We assessed effects on DNA concentration and quality and used metabarcoding to detect changes in bacterial and …"
