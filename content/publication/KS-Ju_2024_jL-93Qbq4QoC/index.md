abstract: "Insect defoliation is a widespread cause of forest disturbance in Canada, and it has the potential to alter terrestrial carbon contributions to stream consumers and thus affect stream ecosystems. Although defoliation by spruce budworms (Choristoneura fumiferana) is considered a natural disturbance with importance to forest succession, the magnitude and duration of outbreaks are increasing, and there is a growing need to understand their downstream consequences. To examine this, algal productivity and autochthonous (in-stream) energy supporting macroinvertebrate and fish consumers (using δ13C, δ15N) were examined in 12 streams in the Gaspé Peninsula, Québec, Canada, that ranged in watershed defoliation from spruce budworm. Hierarchical partitioning models were used to assess the contributions of watershed and stream variables to these endpoints. Total seasonal algal production ranged fourfold …"
