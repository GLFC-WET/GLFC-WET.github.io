abstract: "The effects of forest harvesting on headwaters are quite well understood, yet our understanding of whether impacts accumulate or dissipate downstream is limited. To address this, we investigated whether several biotic indicators changed from smaller to larger downstream sites (n = 6) within three basins that had intensive, extensive or minimal forest management in New Brunswick (Canada). Biofilm biomass and grazer abundance significantly increased from upstream to downstream, whereas organic matter decomposition and the autotrophic index of biofilms decreased. However, some spatial trends differed among basins and indicated either cumulative (macroinvertebrate abundance, predator density, sculpin GSI) or dissipative (autotrophic index, cotton decomposition) effects downstream, potentially explained by sediment and nutrient dynamics related to harvesting. No such among-basin differences were …"
