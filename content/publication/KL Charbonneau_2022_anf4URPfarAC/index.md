abstract: "Forest harvesting affects dissolved organic matter (DOM) and aqueous mercury inputs as well as the food web structure in small-headwater streams, but how these upstream changes manifest downstream is unclear. To address this uncertainty, we examined DOM quality, autochthony in the caddisfly Hydropsychidae (using d2H), and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in stream water and the caddisfly along a longitudinal gradient (first- to fourth-order streams, subcatchments of 50–1900 ha) in paired partially harvested and reference catchments in central Ontario, Canada. Although measures of DOM quality (specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm 2.20–11.62) and autochthony in caddisflies (4.9%–34.0%) varied among sites, no upstream-to-downstream differences in these measures were observed between the paired harvested and reference catchments. In contrast, MeHg levels in stream water (0.06–0 …"
