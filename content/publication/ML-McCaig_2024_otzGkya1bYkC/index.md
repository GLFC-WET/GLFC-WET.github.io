abstract: "Defoliation by eastern spruce budworm is one of the most important natural disturbances in Canadian boreal and hemi‐boreal forests with annual area affected surpassing that of fire and harvest combined, and its impacts are projected to increase in frequency, severity, and range under future climate scenarios. Deciding on an active management strategy to control outbreaks and minimize broader economic, ecological, and social impacts is becoming increasingly important. These strategies differ in the degree to which defoliation is suppressed, but little is known about the downstream consequences of defoliation and, thus, the implications of management. Given the disproportionate role of headwater streams and their microbiomes on net riverine productivity across forested landscapes, we investigated the effects of defoliation by spruce budworm on headwater stream habitat and microbiome structure and …"
