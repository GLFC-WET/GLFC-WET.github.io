abstract: "Increasing forest cover by regreening mining and smelting degraded landscapes provides an opportunity for global carbon (C) sequestration, however, the reported effects of regreening on soil C processes are mixed. One of the world's largest regreening programs is in the City of Greater Sudbury, Canada and has been ongoing since 1978. Prior to regreening, soils in the City of Greater Sudbury area were highly eroded, acidic, rich in metals, and poor in nutrients. This study used a chronosequence approach to investigate how forest soil C pools and fluxes have changed with stand age in highly “eroded” sites with minimal soil cover (n = 6) and “stable” sites covered by soil (n = 6). Encouragingly, the relationship between stand age and soil C processes (litterfall, litter decomposition, soil respiration, fine root growth) at both stable and eroded sites were comparable to observations reported for jack pine (Pinus …"
