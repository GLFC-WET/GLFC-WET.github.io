To assess whether current forest management practices impact stream ecosystems, a five-year study was conducted in J.D. Irving, Limited’s Black Brook Forestry District (New Brunswick, Canada) and in other watersheds with varying forest management intensity. This study was divided into two phases, with each addressing one main research question: 1) how different intensities of forest management affect the ecological health of headwater streams and, 2) whether the changes observed in headwater streams accumulate or dissipate in larger downstream rivers.

However, there is still risk of direct effects on non-target species as some insecticides function as hormone mimics, or through indirect pathways as the insecticide is broken down in the environment. Tebufenozide, an ecdysone hormone mimic, is the active ingredient in insecticides used in a variety of large scale pest control programs. An oft cited reason for the safety of Tebufenozide is that it is rapidly broken down in the environment by microbes. We investigated the potential non-target effects of two Tebufenozide formulations used in Canada, Mimic 240LV and Limit 240, on aquatic communities using an outdoor mesocosm experiment.

DOM is more susceptible to degradation closer to its source and becomes increasingly dominated by the same, difficult-to-degrade compounds as degradation proceeds. However, the processes underlying DOM degradation across environments are poorly understood. Here we found DOM changed similarly along soil-aquatic gradients irrespective of differences in environmental conditions. Using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, we tracked DOM along soil depths and hillslope positions in forest headwater catchments and related its composition to soil microbiomes and physical chemistry. Along depths and hillslopes, carbohydrate-like and unsaturated hydrocarbon-like compounds increased in mass, suggestive of microbial reworking of plant material. More than half of the variation in the abundance of these compounds was related to the expression of genes essential for degrading plant-derived carbohydrates. Our results implicate continuous microbial reworking in shifting DOM towards universal compounds in soils. By synthesising data from the land-to-ocean continuum, we suggest these processes can generalise across ecosystems and spatiotemporal scales. Such general degradation patterns can be leveraged to predict DOM composition and its downstream reactivity along environmental gradients to inform management of soil-to-stream carbon losses.","tags":null,"title":"Universal microbial reworking of dissolved organic matter along environmental gradients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["KL Webster","JA Leach","D Houle","PW Hazlett","Erik Emilson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"023ebc11ccb9e0f3d31dbc93e63701fa","permalink":"/publication/kl-webster_2021_5qfkujpxouwc/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kl-webster_2021_5qfkujpxouwc/","section":"publication","summary":"Long-term ecosystem studies are valuable for understanding integrated ecosystem response to global changes in atmospheric deposition and climate.

Here, we filled mesocosms with artificial lake sediments amended with different ratios and concentrations of coniferous and deciduous tree litter.

Mill.) and spruce (Picea sp.) in North America. Historically, spruce budworm outbreaks have been managed via a reactive, foliage protection approach focused on keeping trees alive rather than stopping the outbreak. However, recent theoretical and technical advances have renewed interest in proactive population control to reduce outbreak spread and magnitude, ie, the Early Intervention Strategy (EIS). In essence, EIS is an area-wide management program premised on detecting and controlling rising spruce budworm populations (hotspots) along the leading edge of an outbreak. In this article, we lay out the conceptual framework for EIS, including all of the core components needed for such a program to be viable. We outline the competing hypotheses of spruce budworm population dynamics and discuss their implications for how we manage outbreaks. We also discuss the practical needs for such a program to be successful (eg, hotspot monitoring, population control, and cost–benefit analyses), as well as the importance of proactive communications with stakeholders.

Through a combination of a questionnaire and a literature review, we evaluated each question on the basis of 2 criteria: relevance and effort.
