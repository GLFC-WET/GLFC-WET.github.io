Although defoliation by spruce budworms (Choristoneura fumiferana) is considered a natural disturbance with importance to forest succession, the magnitude and duration of outbreaks are increasing, and there is a growing need to understand their downstream consequences. To examine this, algal productivity and autochthonous (in-stream) energy supporting macroinvertebrate and fish consumers (using δ13C, δ15N) were examined in 12 streams in the Gaspé Peninsula, Québec, Canada, that ranged in watershed defoliation from spruce budworm. Hierarchical partitioning models were used to assess the contributions of watershed and stream variables to these endpoints.

One understudied consequence of logging is that it accelerates mobilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we tested how logging changed DOM in headwaters of hardwood-dominated catchments in northern Ontario, Canada. We apply a before-after control-impact experiment across four catchments for three years. DOM concentration in streams from logged catchments quadrupled, on average, after the first year post-harvest, but resulting changes to the molecular composition of DOM persisted for at least two-years. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that DOM within logged catchments was more energy-rich and chemically diverse than in controls, with novel highly unsaturated polyphenols, carboxylic-rich alicyclic, and nitrogen-containing formulae. The molecular composition of stream DOM measured fortnightly post-harvest was most strongly associated with DOM composition within intermediate and deeper layers of contributing soils, likely due to increased hydrological connectivity post-harvest. We estimate logging increased the total annual flux of dissolved organic carbon in streams by 6.4% of extracted wood carbon, and this carbon was more likely to be released into the atmosphere. Carbon accounting of forestry, including as a natural climate solution, must now consider the transport and fate of DOM from land into water.","tags":null,"title":"Logging disrupts the ecology of molecules in headwater streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["HK Sidhu","KA Kidd","Erik J.S.

However, the processes underlying DOM degradation across environments are poorly understood. Here we show DOM changes similarly along soil-aquatic gradients irrespective of environmental differences. Using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, we track DOM along soil depths and hillslope positions in forest catchments and relate its composition to soil microbiomes and physico-chemical conditions. Along depths and hillslopes, we find carbohydrate-like and unsaturated hydrocarbon-like compounds increase in abundance-weighted mass, and the expression of genes essential for degrading plant-derived carbohydrates explains 50% of the variation in abundance of these compounds. These results suggest that microbes transform plant-derived compounds, leaving DOM to become increasingly dominated by the same (ie, universal), difficult-to-degrade compounds as degradation proceeds. By synthesising data from the land-to-ocean continuum, we suggest these processes generalise across ecosystems and spatiotemporal scales. Such general degradation patterns can help predict DOM composition and reactivity along environmental gradients to inform management of soil-to-stream carbon losses.","tags":null,"title":"Universal microbial reworking of dissolved organic matter along soil gradients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tyler J Harrow-Lyle","Wai Ying Lam","Erik J.S.

To assess whether current forest management practices impact stream ecosystems, a five-year study was conducted in J.D. Irving, Limited’s Black Brook Forestry District (New Brunswick, Canada) and in other watersheds with varying forest management intensity. This study was divided into two phases, with each addressing one main research question: 1) how different intensities of forest management affect the ecological health of headwater streams and, 2) whether the changes observed in headwater streams accumulate or dissipate in larger downstream rivers. A comprehensive approach to examining these research questions was taken by measuring multiple …","tags":null,"title":"Understanding the effects of forest management on streams and rivers: A synthesis of research conducted in New Brunswick (Canada) 2014–2018","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas PP Braga","Chloé Orland","Erik J.S.

DOM is more susceptible to degradation closer to its source and becomes increasingly dominated by the same, difficult-to-degrade compounds as degradation proceeds. However, the processes underlying DOM degradation across environments are poorly understood. Here we found DOM changed similarly along soil-aquatic gradients irrespective of differences in environmental conditions. Using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, we tracked DOM along soil depths and hillslope positions in forest headwater catchments and related its composition to soil microbiomes and physical chemistry. Along depths and hillslopes, carbohydrate-like and unsaturated hydrocarbon-like compounds increased in mass, suggestive of microbial reworking of plant material. More than half of the variation in the abundance of these compounds was related to the expression of genes essential for degrading plant-derived carbohydrates. Our results implicate continuous microbial reworking in shifting DOM towards universal compounds in soils. By synthesising data from the land-to-ocean continuum, we suggest these processes can generalise across ecosystems and spatiotemporal scales. Such general degradation patterns can be leveraged to predict DOM composition and its downstream reactivity along environmental gradients to inform management of soil-to-stream carbon losses.","tags":null,"title":"Universal microbial reworking of dissolved organic matter along environmental gradients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["KL Webster","JA Leach","D Houle","PW Hazlett","Erik J.S.

The hierarchical nature and longitudinal connectivity of river networks make them fundamentally cumulative, but lateral and vertical connectivity and instream processes can dissipate the downstream transport of water and materials. To elucidate such effects, we investigated how a suite of abiotic indicators changed from small streams to larger downstream sites (n = 6) within three basins ranging in forest management intensity (intensive, extensive, minimal) in New Brunswick (Canada) in the summer and fall of 2017 and 2018.

Mill.) and spruce (Picea sp.) in North America. Historically, spruce budworm outbreaks have been managed via a reactive, foliage protection approach focused on keeping trees alive rather than stopping the outbreak. However, recent theoretical and technical advances have renewed interest in proactive population control to reduce outbreak spread and magnitude, ie, the Early Intervention Strategy (EIS). In essence, EIS is an area-wide management program premised on detecting and controlling rising spruce budworm populations (hotspots) along the leading edge of an outbreak. In this article, we lay out the conceptual framework for EIS, including all of the core components needed for such a program to be viable. We outline the competing hypotheses of spruce budworm population dynamics and discuss their implications for how we manage outbreaks. We also discuss the practical needs for such a program to be successful (eg, hotspot monitoring, population control, and cost–benefit analyses), as well as the importance of proactive communications with stakeholders.
